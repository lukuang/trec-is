## Data

1. One Training data set: [CrisisLexT26](http://crisislex.org/data-collections.html#CrisisLexT26). The training events are supposed to draw from it.
2.  Ontology: can be found [here](http://dcs.gla.ac.uk/~richardm/TREC_IS/WebVOWL/#trecis). But it does not seems to be in the form as suggested in the planing slides. 
3. Test data set: it is supposed to be released on June.
